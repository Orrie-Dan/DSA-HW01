DSA HW01 - Sparse Matrix

This repository contains the implementation of a Sparse Matrix parser and processor as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms assignment.
It provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) for performing the following matrix operations:

Addition (Ensures both matrices have the same dimensions)
Subtraction (Ensures both matrices have the same dimensions)
Multiplication
The program processes the matrices and allows you to specify an output directory for storing results.

steps:
1. Clone repository: 
2. Navigate directory
3. compile (g++ sparsematrix.cpp -o sparsematrix)
4. Run (.\sparsematrix)
5. Select an operation (Addition, Subtraction, or Multiplication)
6. Provide input file paths for the matrices
